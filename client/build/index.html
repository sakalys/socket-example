Each box (frame) has it's own connection to the chat server. You can add more frames by pressing on <em>Add frame</em>, and remove frames by pressing on the "X" on top of each of them.</p><p>The source for this demo is publicly visible on Github — <a href="https://github.com/sakalys/socket-example" target="_blank">https://github.com/sakalys/socket-example</a>.</p><p>Each frame connects to the #public channel automatically. There is an additional #private channel, but to be able to post to it, you must first identify yourself by entering the command <code>/private {pass-phrase}</code> (the pass-phrase in this demo is the word <em>secret</em>. The pass-phrase is checked by the server and if it is correct, then the frame gets access to the #private channel as well. Messages sent to the #private channel will only be visible to other members that are in the #private channel.</p><p>Available commands:</p><ul><li><code>/private {pass-phrase}</code> — access to admin channel (the pass-phrase is <em>secret</em>)</li><li><code>/count</code> — members in channel</li><li><code>/quit</code> — close the frame</li></ul></div><div id="root"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/main.1d74da39.js"></script></body></html>
