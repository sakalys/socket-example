  <h1>Socket.io chat demo</h1>
  <p>
    The following is a chat tool that I built using socket.io to showcase
    how multiple chat clients can interoperate. Each box (frame) has it's own
    connection to the chat server.
    You can add more frames by pressing on <em>Add frame</em>, and remove frames by
    pressing on the "X" on top of each of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The source for this demo is publicly visible on Github —
    <a href="https://github.com/sakalys/socket-example"
       target="_blank">https://github.com/sakalys/socket-example</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each frame connects to the #public channel automatically. There is an additional
    #private channel, but to be able to post to it, you must first identify yourself by
    entering the command <code>/private {pass-phrase}</code> (the pass-phrase in this demo
    is the word <em>secret</em>. The pass-phrase is checked by the server and if it is
    correct, then the frame gets access to the #private channel as well. Messages sent to
    the #private channel will only be visible to other members that are in the #private
    channel.
  </p>

  <p>Available commands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>/private {pass-phrase}</code> — access to admin channel (the pass-phrase is <em>secret</em>)</li>
    <li><code>/count</code> — members in channel</li>
    <li><code>/quit</code> — close the frame</li>
  </ul>
